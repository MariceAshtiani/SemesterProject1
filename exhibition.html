                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, <span class="red">‘The Sky above Us’</span>, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various <span class="red">constellations</span> and <span class="red">galaxies</span> that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
                <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our <span class="red">origins</span>. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since <span class="red">Darwin</span> proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our <span class="yellow">Woolly Mammoth</span>, the <span class="yellow">Dodos</span>, and a number of <span class="red">dinosaurs</span> too.</p>

                <p>From <span class="red">micro-organisms</span> to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much <span class="red">longer</span> and their quality of life much <span class="red">improved</span>, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.</p>
                <p>Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major <span class="red">breakthroughs</span> including the discovery of penicillin and the first <span class="red">heart transplant</span>. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <p>As we learn more and more of the <span class="red">impact</span> humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a <span class="red">sustainable future</span> not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the <span class="red">dangers</span> we currently face including <span class="red">global warming</span>, <span class="red">extinction of species</span>, and <span class="red">pollution</span>. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a <span class="yellow">brighter future</span>.</p>
