A project for a fictional community science museum. 

## Description

The aim for this project was to create a website for a fictional interactive science museum called the Community Science museum. The core target audience for this museum was supposed to be primary and middle school children, and families with young children. The website needed to be informative and appealing, and be responsive on several devices and screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.  

Stages of development:

- Creating userstories and wireframes
- Creating a prototype in Adobe XD
- Using only HTML and CSS to create the website
- bug-fixes, making sure CSS follows DRY-principle
- checking if the page follows SEO-guidelines, if the site is WCAG-compliant.
